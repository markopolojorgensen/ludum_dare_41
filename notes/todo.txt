TODO
  bug: falling through final platform (set global max speed?)
  BUG: restarting the game doesn't clear upgrades
  bug: permaslow mystery?
  bug: multiple towers appear selected after losing access to a third

  SKILL CHAINS
    define skill chains
    force player to second core?
    hints
      bullets shoot at the mouse cursor
      towers appear at the mouse cursor

Significant Improvements
  Sanity
    ABSTRACT SHOOTER BEHAVIOR FOR GOODNESS' SAKE
  Towers
    tower inventory indicators: li'l bubbles :D
      hint: The number of cores you have activated determines the number of towers you can place
        The more cores you have activated, the more towers you can place.
    Can't place more towers once you hit inventory limit
    towers should shoot at enemy bodies, not their feet
    particle effects increase as effect increases (via amp, multiple sources, etc.)
    rework amp improvements so they stack on everything
      reworking stacking in general, effects on towers, enemies, player
    tower animations 
      spin when active
      spin faster when more active :D
      start up / build animation
      tear down / destroy animation
  Environment / Level
    New entry hallway w/ hint: look for hints
    parallax background visuals
      more area clues to help with exploring / getting lost =(
  Cores
    modulate core shield indicators when especially low
    New Core: MAP
    New Core: Tower Inventory Expansion

  Music
    audio should fade in / out (lerp?)

  fullscreen support
  enemies fade in on spawn
  cooler font
  center symbol numbers =( (i.e. fix symbol sprites)
  increase core shields by shooting at it
  custom enemy reclaim core animation
  player dash animation
  change enemy framerate based on slow aoe effects
  towers can only target enemies they can "see" i.e. don't shoot at enemies you can't hit

  (release)
  soundcloud the music



sfx
  door
  enemies
    spawn
    dance
  cores
    activation
    deactivation

  level decorations
    spikes
    tombstones?
    kelp

Tower defense Platformer
  cores
    some cores are powerups
      shooting ability
      player moves faster
      player and tower weapons damage in AOE
    some cores are tower types
      shooter
      aoe slow tower
      amplifier
        increases tower shoot speed
        increases player shoot speed
        increases slow effect

    acquiring X cores unlocks shortcuts between areas?

  player movement destroys enemies?
  main goal: destroy enemy core
  cores unlock doors, unlock all doors to get access to enemy core
  enemy spawn rate scales with number of activated cores
  tower availability scales with number of activated cores
  all cores are sort of under attack constantly
  core shields regenerate when player is nearby
  there are specific places for enemies to spawn
