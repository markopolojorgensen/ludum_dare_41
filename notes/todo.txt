TODO
  BUG: restarting the game doesn't clear upgrades
  towers should shoot at enemy bodies, not their feet
  parallax background visuals
  particle effects increase as effect increases (via amp, multiple sources, etc.)
  towers spin
  modulate core shield indicators when especially low
  audio should fade in / out (lerp?)
  hint: The number of cores you have activated determines the number of towers you can place
    The more cores you have activated, the more towers you can place.

  fullscreen support
  enemies fade in on spawn
  cooler font
  center symbol numbers =(
  increase core shields by shooting at it
  custom enemy reclaim core animation
  player dash animation
  change enemy framerate based on slow aoe effects
  towers can only target enemies they can "see" i.e. don't shoot at enemies you can't hit

    acquiring X cores unlocks shortcuts between areas?

  player movement destroys enemies?
  main goal: destroy enemy core
  cores unlock doors, unlock all doors to get access to enemy core
  enemy spawn rate scales with number of activated cores
  tower availability scales with number of activated cores
  all cores are sort of under attack constantly
  core shields regenerate when player is nearby
  there are specific places for enemies to spawn
